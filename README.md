Have you ever wanted to play a puzzle game with a storyline where the savior of the day is female, with riddles to teach you about achievements by women? Well, look no further!

## About this project
We wanted to make a game that combined elements of puzzle games with something that could be inspiring to women who want to make an impact on the world by showing that women have accomplished some pretty amazing things. We did this by creating a tile puzzle game with riddles that give you interesting facts about the achievements of women and women in STEM and publishing it to a domain.
